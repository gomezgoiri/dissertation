\subsection{Conclusions} % or Discussion???

Section~\ref{sec:sw_intermediaries} presents the most common approaches to use \ac{sw} in \ac{ubicomp}: delegate on intermediaries the semantization of the raw data.
However, we do not intend to follow this path.
Instead, we propose to share semantic content directly from the embedded and mobile platforms as the solutions in Section~\ref{sec:sw_providers} do.
This completely distributed approach tries to simplify the maintenance burden and promote the access to the most updated data.


Regarding searching, the solutions on Section~\ref{sec:sw_providers} promote a less distributed search.
Instead, our model tries to enhance searching capability of web-connected things.
This improvement leads to environments where any devices directly interact and collaborate with each other.
