% no habría que definir de nuevo y de manera formal ubicomp o vale con la intro?
Due to the heterogeneity of technologies present in \ac{ubicomp} environments, % computing platforms, protocols, etc.
our solution should carefully consider the \emph{interoperability}.
The IEEE defines interoperability as \emph{the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged}.
The definition clearly distinguishes between two requirements: % o goals o incremental requirements
(1) to exchange information (i.e. \emph{integration}); and
(2) to use that information. % to understand others data (i.e. \emph{interoperation}).

For the lower-levels of the exchange, we opt for interoperability \emph{ab-initio} relying in standard and widely accepted communication protocols. % e.g. HTTP
For a higher-level (i.e. application layer), Section~\ref{} categorizes integration approaches and describes the ones explored in this dissertation.

% Sintáctica vs semántica
Regarding the second goal, 
Section~\ref{} stresses the need of the \acl{sw} for these environments.
