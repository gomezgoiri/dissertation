In this section we will explore the related work by firstly studying other common integration approaches for Ubicomp applications.
Then, we will stress the need of the Semantic Web for these environments and we will scrutinize how other authors have use it.
Finally, we will analyze the works which use an specific semantic integration paradigm: Triple Space Computing.
