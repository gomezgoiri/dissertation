In Section~\ref{sec:soa_ubicomp}, rather than presenting an exhaustive (and exhausting) survey on these topics, we explore their impact in the \ac{ubicomp} field. % their impact vs their combination
To that end, we identify the relevant works remarking their interesting characteristics and how they relate to this dissertation.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:soa_tsc} analyzes and compares other semantic \ac{ts} middlewares independently of their application domain.
