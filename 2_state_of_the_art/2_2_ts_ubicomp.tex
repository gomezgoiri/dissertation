The \emph{event heap} \citep{johanson_extending_2004} is a system used for a specific \ac{ubicomp} sub-domain: interactive workspaces.
In this scenario there are rooms with different devices deployed and where mobile devices can enter.
Each room has its own space where the devices exchanging tuples to cooperate.
%For example, a video can be presented in a display and through a remote controller, the user can place the tuple for pausing it.
%The display consumes these kind of tuples, so it pauses the video whenever somebody places that tuple on the space.
% This system is simple to implement but is limited since it centralizes the space in a single machine per room.
This work merely identifies the requirements of these environments and the properties which solve them.
Then, it discusses how these properties can be satisfied using \ac{ts} or some extensions.
Finally they compare its implementation both with other \acp{ts} implementations or other coordination infrastructures. % e.g. RMI, MOM, Pub/sub

Although the analysis presented by \citeauthor{johanson_extending_2004} identifies the key requirements for \ac{ts} in \ac{ubicomp},
the solution they propose is purely centralized.
We opted for a distributed solution at the expense of limiting some of the features.

\emph{L$^2$imbo} \citep{davies_l2imbo:_1998,friday_experiences_1999} replicates the tuples to avoid a single point of failure.
Each node joined to a space uses an IP multicast address to exchange messages with other nodes in that space.
Writing into a space involves sending a multicast message to inform to the rest of the nodes of the tuple written.
Reading operation usually requires local reading.
Destructive reading of the tuple is more complex as it requires a global withdrawal.
In \emph{L$^2$imbo} only the owner of a tuple can remove it from the space.
The ownership of a tuple initially belongs to its creator, but can be transferred. % TODO ver qué añadió Friday

\emph{LIME} (Linda in a Mobile Environment) \citep{picco_lime:_1999} is a TS solution for mobile systems.
In LIME each mobile device has its own space where it generally writes its tuples.
This space is shared with other devices creating federated spaces, i.e. the aggregation of different shared spaces.
In this way, each mobile can access to tuples in other mobiles whenever they become available.
They also proposed a new writing primitive to insert tuples in remote spaces.
% ejemplo de service discovery?

This is difficult to implement and \citet{coulouris_distributed_2012} complain about the unrealistic assumptions they make to simplify the problem. % cita al libro
These assumptions are the uniform multicast connectivity between devices whose tuple spaces are aggregated and the serialized and ordered connections and disconnections.
In any case, LIME was adapted to several platforms to run both in embedded and mobile devices \citep{murphy_transiently_2006}.


In the \emph{TOTA} (Tuples On The Air) Project \citep{mamei_programming_2009} tuples are disseminated to different devices.
To that end, each tuple has 3 fields:
1) the content of the tuple,
2) a rule which defines how it should be propagated,
3) a rule to define its maintenance.
For instance, they consider a museum where a visitor writes a query tuple describing a piece of art he wants to see.
The propagation rule defines that it should be propagated to all nodes in the vicinity, increasing the distance by one each time.
The tuple is configured to be deleted after a time-to-live period using its maintenance rule.
When the it reaches the room where the piece of art is located, the piece of art will write a response tuple.
This response tuple jumps from a device to another until it reaches the device which queried for it.
