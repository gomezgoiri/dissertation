% Definiciones de middleware en el libro de Coulouris:
%
% (pag 17):
% Middleware • The term middleware applies to a software layer that provides a
% programming abstraction as well as masking the heterogeneity of the underlying
% networks, hardware, operating systems and programming languages.
%
% (en otra parte):
% The task of middleware is to provide a higher-level
% programming abstraction for the development of distributed systems and, through
% layering, to abstract over heterogeneity in the underlying infrastructure to promote
% interoperability and portability.


The integration of two applications is driven by how they communicate.
To ease that communication the applications use middlewares.
A middleware is a software layer which provides a higher level of abstraction and masks the underlying heterogeneity.
\citet{coulouris_distributed_2012} define two communication styles on the upper layer of a middleware: % figura 4.1 modificada para incluir elementos
the remote invocation and the indirect communication (see Figure~\ref{fig:middleware_layers}).

The \emph{remote invocation} involves the most common two-way exchange between senders and receivers in distributed systems.
In contrast, the \emph{indirect communication} comprehends decoupled communications between senders and receivers.


Within the \emph{remote invocation} style, RESTful style \citep{fielding_architectural_2000} and the well known set of WS-* \citep{alonso_web_2010} standards probably represent the most popular substyles.
In Section~\ref{sec:remote_invocation}, we analyze their application to the \ac{ubicomp} field, particularly focusing on the \ac{iot}.


% Otros técnicas indirectas:  group communication, publish-subscribe system, message queue systems, shared memory–based approaches
\aclp{ts} is a paradigm which promotes indirect communication.
In \ac{ts} the entities write data in a persistent space and read it specifying patterns of interest.
In Section~\ref{sec:indirect_communication}, we study the most relevant \acl{ts} solutions proposed for the \acl{ubicomp}.
