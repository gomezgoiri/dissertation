    Network size & The number of nodes in a network. In the simulations conducted, all the nodes are \providers{}. \\
    Number of writes & Amount of writes performed during the simulation period. \\
    Number of queries & Amount of queries performed during the simulation period. \\
    Number of \consumers{} & Amount of nodes querying to other nodes in the \Space{}. \\
    Distribution strategy & Our solution or \ac{nb}. \\
    & In \ac{nb} nodes write locally and spread the queries to the rest of the nodes in the \Space{}. \\
    Drop interval & At the beginning of this interval a node abruptly leaves the network. \\
    & At the end, the node joins the network and a new one is chosen to leave it. \\
