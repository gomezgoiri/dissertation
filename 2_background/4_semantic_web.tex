\section{The \acl{sw}}
\label{sec:soa_sw}

A problem of the initial view of the Web was that it was human-centred.
Regardless of whether the contents were machine processable, a human needed to interpret them to give them a meaning.

In the early 2000s, \citet{berners-lee_semantic_2001} proposed a solution to this problem: the \acf{sw}.
%The \ac{sw} was conceived as an extension of the ordinary web which would bring structure to its content.
%As the ordinary web, the \ac{sw} benefits from the universality the hypertext provides by linking \emph{anything with anything}.
%Besides, like the Internet, the \ac{sw} is intended to be as decentralized as possible.
The \emph{World Wide Web Consortium} defines the \ac{sw} and its key features as follows \citep{semanticWeb-FAQ}:
\begin{quote}
The vision of the \acl{sw} is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., \acs{uri}-s;
data should be \emph{related to one another} just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
This also means creation of a common framework that allows data to be \emph{shared and reused} across application, enterprise, and community boundaries,
to be \emph{processed automatically} by tools as well as manually, including revealing possible \emph{new relationships} among pieces of data.
\end{quote}


In the \ac{sw}, triples are the most basic information units.
A triple is composed by a subject, a predicate and an object like in a normal sentence (see Figure~\ref{fig:triples_example}).
As \citeauthor{berners-lee_semantic_2001} explained, using triples ``\emph{a document can assert that things (people, web pages or whatever) have properties (such as 'is a sister of', 'is the author of') with certain values (another person, another Web page)}''.
A key difference with a normal sentence is that each concept is unambiguously defined by an \acs{uri}.
These \acsp{uri} form links between different triples as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:triples_example}.
% This set of triples can be expressed in multiple formats such as RDF, Turtle, Notation3 or NTriples. % TODO citas

  Sample triples using different ontologies.

  All the triples are represented graphically and some of them also textually.
  They describe a researcher's academic and personal details.
  The knowledge is expressed using four different ontologies: FOAF \citeweb{foaf}, DC \citeweb{dc}, SWRC \citeweb{swrc} and CiTO \citeweb{cito}.
  For the sake of clarity, some of the \acs{uri}s in the figure are shortened using aliases or prefixes. % una o la otra

A problem with the information described so far is that two different databases may use different \acs{uri}s to express the same concept.
To overcome this the \ac{sw} offers collections of information called ontologies.
An ontology is a document which expresses the relations between terms commonly using a taxonomy and a set of rules to infer content.
The taxonomy defines the classes of a given domain and how they relate with each other.

% W3C on Ontology vs Vocabulary: http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology
% There is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”.
% The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms,
% whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense.

Of course, different content providers may provide similar data described according to different ontologies.
To overcome this problem, ontologies can be easily mapped by providing equivalence relations within them.
Similarly, an ontology can be extended to adapt it to different application domains.
In any case, the reuse of the same models is beneficial to ease the interoperability.
This reuse is promoted by the community through the standardization of vocabularies.

% Remarkably, the use of the \ac{sw} has been promoted in the last years with the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative.
% The LOD are datasets which follow a series of principles on how to open and publish data.
% The ultimate goal of the LOD is to publish linked terms using full semantics.
