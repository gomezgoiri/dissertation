Dissertation 
============

This is the VSC repository for [Aitor GÃ³mez-Goiri](http://gomezgoiri.net)'s dissertation entitled: _Semantic Tuple Spaces for Constrained Devices: A Web-compliant Vision_.

For more information about the dissertation, please check [this page](http://gomezgoiri.net/publications/gomezgoiri-semantic.html).

I have opened this repository mainly for those of you who are interested in LaTeX related issues and want to learn by example.

If (after googling it) you don't understand how something works, ask on the [forums](http://tex.stackexchange.com/).
If this doesn't work either, then, and only then, you can try asking me 0:-)


For anything else (e.g., suggestions on the content), just send me an email ;-)
