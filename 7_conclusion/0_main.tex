% Presentar de qué ha ido la tesis (TODO añadir capítulos en los que se ha ido tratando?)
% 3 ptos con los que quiero que el lector se quede: searching, acting y compatibility with WoT

This dissertation explores the design of a distributed \ac{tsc} middleware suitable for \ac{ubicomp} environments.
The middleware's most remarkable characteristic is its alignment with the web world.
This alignment pursues the interoperability of the middleware with other semantic web applications and semantic \ac{wot} solutions.
Firstly, it reuses their data requiring them to implement a minimal \ac{rest}-like \ac{api}.
Secondly, it enables these third-party web applications to reuse the data written into the space by means of an analogous \ac{api}. % analogous, equivalent, similar


To preserve as many beneficial properties as possible from the web and \ac{ts} worlds, the middleware presents a conceptual division of each \Space{} (Chapter~\ref{cha:tsc}).
Any \Space{} is composed by the \coordspace{} and the \outerspace{}.
The \coordspace{} enables a completely indirect communication, time and space decoupled, between the nodes which write and read semantic content into it.
The \outerspace{} acknowledges the distributed nature of \ac{ubicomp} environments by letting the nodes manage their own semantic content.
However, this content is shared with the rest of nodes forming a \emph{virtual} space.
Developers access the content of the space in a associative manner keeping the space decoupling property.
Both spaces are accessed through a resource-oriented \ac{http} \ac{api} to promote their data reuse by third-party \ac{rest} or \ac{rest}-like applications.


The distribution of the information avoids participants' dependency on other devices, but arises other challenges.
This dissertation tackles two main challenges: how to search in a decentralized way (Chapter~\ref{cha:searching}) and how to act on the physical environment through the space (Chapter~\ref{cha:actuate}).


To enhance the search process between devices limiting their dependencies on others, this dissertation proposes an architecture.
This architecture dynamically chooses an intermediary according to its capabilities to support the most limited devices.
The final result is that fewer requests are required in overall, specifically reducing the load on resource constrained devices.
As a result, their energy consumption is also reduced.
% es independiente de nuestra solucion: se puede aplicar a otras cosas


To actuate on the physical environment, the dissertation explains how to apply \ac{ts} application patterns to the \ac{ubicomp} vision.
%Specifically, tasks and results for these tasks are read and written into the space.
% Necesidad de suscripciones
Although these actuation mechanisms promote indirect communication between the nodes, they require them to use the coordination space.
This impedes to seamlessly integrate actuators from the \ac{wot} world. % without a gateway.
To avoid that, i.e., to promote the reuse of third-party \ac{wot} applications' actuation capabilities, we describe how to integrate a \ac{rest}-based actuation mechanism with the regular \ac{tsc} usage.
%Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are presented.
