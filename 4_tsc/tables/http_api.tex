\InsertTab{tab:tscAPI}{\acs{http} mapping for the primitives detailed in the Section~\ref{sec:primitives}}{
  \textit{sp} is a space \acs{uri},
  \textit{g} is a graph \acs{uri}, \textit{s}, \textit{p} and \textit{o-uri} are subject, predicate and object \acsp{uri} or wildcards (represented with an as \textit{*}).
  When the template's object is a literal, it can be expressed specifying its value (\textit{o-val}) and its type (\textit{o-type}).
