After having presented the general research topics in which this work fits, we analyse the specific works closely related to ours.
This thesis focuses on the intersection of the three topics represented in the Figure~\ref{fig:venn_ubicomp_tuple_semantic}. % puede liar que REST no aparezca y UbiComp si? (diff con Chapter 2)
It also stresses in which areas the following sections focus on.


% TODO definir en algún puto lado a qué nos referimos con Ubicomp
%      para mostrar porque no incluimos otros trabajos
Firstly, Section~\ref{sec:soa_ubicomp} explores relevant works on the \ac{ubicomp} field.
Rather than presenting an exhaustive (and exhausting) survey on middlewares for \ac{ubicomp},
we analyse those which follow the \ac{rest} architectural style.
Then, we remark how we can solve the main limitations of these works by using a \ac{ts} middleware.


Secondly, Section~\ref{sec:soa_ts_ubicomp} scrutinizes relevant \ac{ts} proposals for the \ac{ubicomp} field.
Specifically, we study their space model and, for the distributed proposals, how they distribute the tuples.
Then, we present and justify our model's similarities and divergences with theirs.


Thirdly, Section~\ref{sec:soa_sw_ubicomp} presents some semantic works for \ac{ubicomp}.
From these works we derive two main approaches to semantically annotate content provided by limited devices:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
  \item do it in more powerful intermediaries; and
  \item directly involve all the devices in the management of their content.
\end{enumerate*}
This work is interested in the second approach.
Regarding related research following this approach, we inspect their complementary proposals but we distinguish the unaddressed needs covered by Chapter~\ref{cha:searching}. %: direct search between devices.


Finally, Section~\ref{sec:soa_tsc} analyses and compares in detail other semantic \ac{ts} middlewares independently of their application domain.
