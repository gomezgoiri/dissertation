Here, we describe two models and systems, {TinyLime} and {TeenyLime}, providing transiently shared tuple spaces in two diﬀerent {WSN} operational scenarios, and elaborate on alternate designs and opportunities.},

	title = {Extending {ReSpecT} for multiple coordination flows},
	abstract = {{Abstract—In} this paper, the {ReSpecT} specification language for programming the behaviour of tuple centres is extended with the out tc predicate, enabling communication between tuple centres. The extension is formally defined, and its benefits in the management of multiple coordination flows are outlined. The paper shows how relevant interaction scenarios – typically event-oriented – can be framed as multiple coordination flow problems, and properly engineered using tuple centres with the extended {ReSpecT} language. In particular, first {ReSpecT} is used to implement a well-known coordination primitive – copy-collect –, provided by some tuple-based model as a building block for managing multiple coordination flows; then the {Publish/Subscribe} interaction pattern is taken into account, showing how {ReSpecT} tuple centres can be used for the design of flexible event notification services. For sake of concreteness, two examples are then developed: a {JavaSpacesand} T Spaces-like notification 
service, and a patient monitoring system, involving the notification of complex event patterns.},

	abstract = {Mobile computing environments increasingly consist of a range of supporting technologies offering a diverse set of capabilities to applications and end-systems. Such environments are characterised by sudden and dramatic changes in the quality-of-service ({QoS)} available to applications and users. Recent work has shown that distributed systems platforms can assist applications to take advantage of these changes in {QoS} and, more specifically, facilitate applications to adapt to their environment. However, the current state-of-the-art in these platforms reflects their fixed network origins through their choice of synchronous connection-oriented communications paradigms. In this paper we argue that these paradigms are not well suited to operation in the emerging mobile environments. Furthermore, we offer an alternative programming paradigm based on tuple spaces which, we believe, offers a number of benefits within a mobile context. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a 
new platform based on this paradigm.},

In order to test the feasibility of our approach, a prototypical implementation of our model in the {TuCSoN} infrastructure featuring the Pellet semantic reasoner is described and discussed.},
