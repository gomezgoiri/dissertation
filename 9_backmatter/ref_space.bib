Here, we describe two models and systems, {TinyLime} and {TeenyLime}, providing transiently shared tuple spaces in two diﬀerent {WSN} operational scenarios, and elaborate on alternate designs and opportunities.},

The core technology, so simple to use, allows billions of users to publish, share and consume information from all over the world. The addition of so-called Web services that enable the remote execution of applications delivered a new dimension of communication, in particular in {B2B} and {EAI} systems. The same counts for the recent achievements around the Semantic Web. In this paper we present our work towards a scalable semantic middleware that further enables the integration, communication and coordination of billions of autonomous, distributed and heterogeneous service providers and consumers. Such middleware is the fundamental building block for the realization of Web services and the Semantic Web in the true Web sense: scalable, open and very simple to use.},

	abstract = {Mobile computing environments increasingly consist of a range of supporting technologies offering a diverse set of capabilities to applications and end-systems. Such environments are characterised by sudden and dramatic changes in the quality-of-service ({QoS)} available to applications and users. Recent work has shown that distributed systems platforms can assist applications to take advantage of these changes in {QoS} and, more specifically, facilitate applications to adapt to their environment. However, the current state-of-the-art in these platforms reflects their fixed network origins through their choice of synchronous connection-oriented communications paradigms. In this paper we argue that these paradigms are not well suited to operation in the emerging mobile environments. Furthermore, we offer an alternative programming paradigm based on tuple spaces which, we believe, offers a number of benefits within a mobile context. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a 
new platform based on this paradigm.},
