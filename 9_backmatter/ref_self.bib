	title = {Assessing Data Dissemination Strategies within Triple Spaces on the Web of Things},
	doi = {10.1109/IMIS.2012.120},
	abstract = {The upcoming of the Web of Things initiative has improved the integration of Internet-connected devices through the standard {HTTP} protocol and other web techniques. Unfortunately, it usually defines the data shared by these devices in a syntactic level, showing a lack of expressiveness. During the last decade, the Semantic Web ({SW)} has aimed to solve these problems by adding logic to the Web to make it machine-understandable and by therefore enhancing the interoperability of the applications using it. The {SW} is used in the Triple Space Computing paradigm, which proposes a blackboard model where semantically described knowledge is shared between different devices in a completely Restful, and consequently {WoT} compliant, manner. This paradigm's shared blackboard can be implemented using many strategies, from centralized to completely distributed. In this work, we compare and analyze the behaviors of these two extreme cases in several simulations which try to represent common {IoT} scenarios.
 Finally, we propose an improvement of the completely distributed strategy by enabling the gossiping between devices.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT)} enables communication among real-world things and devices through Internet. So far, {IoT} research has focused on allowing such communication through different protocols and architectures. Some of these architectural approaches are Web of Things ({WoT)} and Triple Space ({TS)} which are both resource oriented architectures. This work analyses and compares both approaches and outlines the scenarios in which they will be more useful. Particularly, it outlines how some of the drawbacks of {WoT} in the discovery and cooperation aspects may be complemented by integrating with {TS.}},

This work analyses the adoption of Triple Spaces coordination language by very heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices and outlines how its primitives can help to develop fully distributed and very decoupled scenarios.},

	abstract = {The demand for Internet-enabled objects which expose their content in a {RESTful} and web compliant manner is increasing. Consequently, these objects have to face well-known problems from the web world. The lack of expressiveness and human orientation of the syntactically described capabilities and contents of those resources is one of these difficulties. The Semantic Web on the contrary interlinks each object's data to one another, enabling its automatic process to reveal possible new relationships and therefore enhancing the interoperability of semantic-enabled objects. In this work we present a semantically enabled Web of Things compliant {HTTP} interface for Internet-enabled objects which uses Triple Spaces ({TS)} as a basis. Specifically, we address the adoption of this paradigm by a wide range of resource constrained devices assessing the feasibility of our middle-ware solution, focusing both on the web and on the semantic aspects. Besides, we stress the degree of interoperability achieved 
by the applications made using {RESTful} {TS} by describing two scenarios where it could be used.},

We focus on a minimal use of computation, energy and storage resources at wireless sensors so as to address constrained devices: the proposed methods for key distribution and access control rely on extremely fast key derivation functions and, for the same reason, memory usage is reduced since keys are computed on the fly when needed. Our solution achieves privacy, authentication, semantic security, low energy, low computational demand and impacts mitigation of compromised devices on a simple manner. The access control provided is based on user identity and time intervals. We discuss these properties, compare our proposal to previous related work and provide experimental results that confirm its viability.},
