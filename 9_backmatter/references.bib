	abstract = {Like many other incipient technologies, Web services are still surrounded by a substantial level of noise. This noise results from the always dangerous combination of wishful thinking on the part of research and industry and of a lack of clear understanding of how Web services came to be. On the one hand, multiple contradictory interpretations are created by the many attempts to realign existing technology and strategies with Web services. On the other hand, the emphasis on what could be done with Web services in the future often makes us lose track of what can be really done with Web services today and in the short term. These factors make it extremely difficult to get a coherent picture of what Web services are, what they contribute, and where they will be {applied.Alonso} and his co-authors deliberately take a step back. Based on their academic and industrial experience with middleware and enterprise application integration systems, they describe the fundamental concepts behind the notion of 
Web services and present them as the natural evolution of conventional middleware, necessary to meet the challenges of the Web and of {B2B} application integration. Rather than providing a reference guide or a "how to write your first Web service" kind of book, they discuss the main objectives of Web services, the challenges that must be faced to achieve them, and the opportunities that this novel technology provides. Established, as well as recently proposed, standards and techniques (e.g., {WSDL}, {UDDI}, {SOAP}, {WS-Coordination}, {WS-Transactions}, and {BPEL)}, are then examined in the context of this discussion in order to emphasize their scope, benefits, and shortcomings. Thus, the book is ideally suited both for professionals considering the development of application integration solutions and for research and students interesting in understanding and contributing to the evolution of enterprise application technologies.},

The extension is formally defined, and its benefits in the management of multiple coordination flows are outlined. The paper shows how relevant interaction scenarios – typically event-oriented – can be framed as multiple coordination flow problems, and properly engineered using tuple centres with the extended {ReSpecT} language. In particular, first {ReSpecT} is used to implement a well-known coordination primitive – copy-collect –, provided by some tuple-based model as a building block for managing multiple coordination flows; then the {Publish/Subscribe} interaction pattern is taken into account, showing how {ReSpecT} tuple centres can be used for the design of flexible event notification services. For sake of concreteness, two examples are then developed: a {JavaSpacesand} T Spaces-like notification 
service, and a patient monitoring system, involving the notification of complex event patterns.},

	abstract = {Mobile computing environments increasingly consist of a range of supporting technologies offering a diverse set of capabilities to applications and end-systems. Such environments are characterised by sudden and dramatic changes in the quality-of-service ({QoS)} available to applications and users. Recent work has shown that distributed systems platforms can assist applications to take advantage of these changes in {QoS} and, more specifically, facilitate applications to adapt to their environment. However, the current state-of-the-art in these platforms reflects their fixed network origins through their choice of synchronous connection-oriented communications paradigms. In this paper we argue that these paradigms are not well suited to operation in the emerging mobile environments. Furthermore, we offer an alternative programming paradigm based on tuple spaces which, we believe, offers a number of benefits within a mobile context. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a 
new platform based on this paradigm.},

In this article we present {TOTA} ({“Tuples} On The Air”), a novel middleware and programming approach for supporting adaptive context-aware activities in pervasive and mobile computing scenarios. The key idea in {TOTA} is to rely on spatially distributed tuples, adaptively propagated across a network on the basis of application-specific rules, for both representing contextual information and supporting uncoupled interactions between application components. {TOTA} promotes a simple way of programming that facilitates access to distributed information, navigation in complex environments, and the achievement of complex coordination tasks in a fully distributed and adaptive way, mostly freeing programmers and system managers from the need to take care of low-level issues related to network dynamics.

The {SWE} specifications enable a standardized communication and interaction with arbitrary types of sensors and sensor systems. The central concepts within {OGC’s} Sensor Web architecture are sensors, observations and features of interest. Sensors and their observations can be registered and stored through the Sensor Observation Service ({SOS)} to make them accessible for clients. So far, mechanisms are missing which support a semantic matching between features of interest stored in a database and referred to by an observation. The same applies for the matching between observations as sensor outputs and the properties of the features of interest. By taking a use case from disaster management, we outline the challenges and demonstrate how semantically annotated 
{SWE} data models and service interfaces support semantic matching. The result is a roadmap towards a semantically enabled sensor plug \& play within the Sensor Web.},

They can describe themselves, including their services, sensors, and capabilities, by means of {RDF} documents. Used in a protocol stack that provides Internet connectivity ({6LowPAN)} and a service layer ({CoAP)}, a sensor can autoconfigure itself, connect to the Internet, and provide Linked Data without manual intervention. We introduce Streaming {HDT}, a lightweight serialization format for {RDF} documents that allows for transmitting compressed documents with minimal effort for the encoding; this is tailored for typical {IoT} applications where the embedded devices are often senders and seldom receivers of complete documents.},

	shorttitle = {{sTuples}},
	doi = {10.1109/MOBIQ.2004.1331733},
	abstract = {Tuple spaces offer a coordination infrastructure for communication between autonomous entities by providing a logically shared memory along with data persistence, transactional security as well as temporal and spatial decoupling - properties that make it desirable in distributed systems for e-commerce and pervasive computing applications. In most tuple space implementations, tuples are retrieved by employing type-value matching of ordered tuples, object-based polymorphic matching, or {XML-style} pattern matching. In a heterogeneous environment, this can pose several limitations. This paper discusses the architecture and implementation of a prototype semantic infrastructure, which uses semantic Web technologies to represent and retrieve tuples from a tuple space. Semantic tuple spaces ({sTuples)} overcomes limitations of the {JavaSpaces} tuple space implementation, by making use of a Web ontology language and {RACER}, a description-logic reasoning engine. The {sTuples} infrastructure extends and 
integrates with Vigil, a secure framework for communication and access of intelligent services in a pervasive environment. Specialized agents, such as the tuple-recommender agent, task-execution agent and publish-subscribe agent, which have a better understanding of the environment, reside on the tuple space and play an important role in providing user-centric reasoning.},

There, each tuple centre is extended with the ontological description of the coordination domain, expressed by means of the {W3C} standard {OWL.} Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our coordination model smoothly extends the standard syntactic setting of tuple spaces, allowing tuple centres to encapsulate the semantic representation of the domain of discourse, and to embody semantic coordination policies. In order to test the feasibility of our approach, a prototypical implementation of our model in the {TuCSoN} infrastructure featuring the Pellet semantic reasoner is described and discussed.},
