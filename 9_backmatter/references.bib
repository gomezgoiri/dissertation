Here, we describe two models and systems, {TinyLime} and {TeenyLime}, providing transiently shared tuple spaces in two diﬀerent {WSN} operational scenarios, and elaborate on alternate designs and opportunities.},

	edition = {1st},
	title = {Web Services: Concepts, Architectures and Applications},
	isbn = {3642078885, 9783642078880},
	shorttitle = {Web Services},
	abstract = {Like many other incipient technologies, Web services are still surrounded by a substantial level of noise. This noise results from the always dangerous combination of wishful thinking on the part of research and industry and of a lack of clear understanding of how Web services came to be. On the one hand, multiple contradictory interpretations are created by the many attempts to realign existing technology and strategies with Web services. On the other hand, the emphasis on what could be done with Web services in the future often makes us lose track of what can be really done with Web services today and in the short term. These factors make it extremely difficult to get a coherent picture of what Web services are, what they contribute, and where they will be {applied.Alonso} and his co-authors deliberately take a step back. Based on their academic and industrial experience with middleware and enterprise application integration systems, they describe the fundamental concepts behind the notion of 
Web services and present them as the natural evolution of conventional middleware, necessary to meet the challenges of the Web and of {B2B} application integration. Rather than providing a reference guide or a "how to write your first Web service" kind of book, they discuss the main objectives of Web services, the challenges that must be faced to achieve them, and the opportunities that this novel technology provides. Established, as well as recently proposed, standards and techniques (e.g., {WSDL}, {UDDI}, {SOAP}, {WS-Coordination}, {WS-Transactions}, and {BPEL)}, are then examined in the context of this discussion in order to emphasize their scope, benefits, and shortcomings. Thus, the book is ideally suited both for professionals considering the development of application integration solutions and for research and students interesting in understanding and contributing to the evolution of enterprise application technologies.},
