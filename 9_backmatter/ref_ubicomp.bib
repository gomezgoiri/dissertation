The {SWE} specifications enable a standardized communication and interaction with arbitrary types of sensors and sensor systems. The central concepts within {OGC’s} Sensor Web architecture are sensors, observations and features of interest. Sensors and their observations can be registered and stored through the Sensor Observation Service ({SOS)} to make them accessible for clients. So far, mechanisms are missing which support a semantic matching between features of interest stored in a database and referred to by an observation. The same applies for the matching between observations as sensor outputs and the properties of the features of interest. By taking a use case from disaster management, we outline the challenges and demonstrate how semantically annotated 
{SWE} data models and service interfaces support semantic matching. The result is a roadmap towards a semantically enabled sensor plug \& play within the Sensor Web.},

Such an easy access to one’s location is instrumental to the development of location-aware applications. However, existing applications are static in that they do not model relations between places and mobile things. Moreover, these applications do not allow to easily map the physical location of mobile devices to virtual resources on the Internet. We attempt to bridge this gap by extending the base concepts that make up the Internet with the physical location of devices, in order to facilitate the development of Web-based location-aware applications for embedded mobile devices. In this chapter, we propose a simple infrastructure for the {“Web} of Things” that extends the existing Web to enable location-aware applications. The proposed solution enables a naturally hierarchic way to search for location-aware devices and the services they provide.},

In this paper, we present a system that helps users control their smart environment, by embedding semantic metadata in the representations of smart things. The system enables users to specify a desirable state of their smart environment and produces a machine-readable description that details which steps are necessary to reach this state, where each step corresponds to a Web request to a smart device. A client application that, for instance, runs on the user's smartphone, then implements these steps to reconfigure the user's smart environment. We report on our experiences when integrating semantic technologies with smart devices and on two use cases from the home and office automation domains that we implemented in our office space.},
