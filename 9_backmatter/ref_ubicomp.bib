Used in a protocol stack that provides Internet connectivity ({6LowPAN)} and a service layer ({CoAP)}, a sensor can autoconfigure itself, connect to the Internet, and provide Linked Data without manual intervention. We introduce Streaming {HDT}, a lightweight serialization format for {RDF} documents that allows for transmitting compressed documents with minimal effort for the encoding; this is tailored for typical {IoT} applications where the embedded devices are often senders and seldom receivers of complete documents.},

This, however, implies that devices are available to the world. In this paper, we propose a platform that enables people to share their Web-enabled devices so that others can use them. We illustrate how to rely on existing social networks and their open {APIs} (e.g. {OpenSocial)} to enable owners to leverage the social structures in place for sharing smart things with others. We finally discuss some of the challenges we identified towards a composable Web of Things.},

	abstract = {The goal of the Sensor Web Enablement ({SWE)} initiative of the Open Geospatial Consortium ({OGC)} is the definition of web service interfaces and data encodings to make sensors discoverable, taskable and accessible on the World Wide Web. The {SWE} specifications enable a standardized communication and interaction with arbitrary types of sensors and sensor systems. The central concepts within {OGC’s} Sensor Web architecture are sensors, observations and features of interest. Sensors and their observations can be registered and stored through the Sensor Observation Service ({SOS)} to make them accessible for clients. So far, mechanisms are missing which support a semantic matching between features of interest stored in a database and referred to by an observation. The same applies for the matching between observations as sensor outputs and the properties of the features of interest. By taking a use case from disaster management, we outline the challenges and demonstrate how semantically annotated 
{SWE} data models and service interfaces support semantic matching. The result is a roadmap towards a semantically enabled sensor plug \& play within the Sensor Web.},
