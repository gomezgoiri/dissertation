In the previous chapter, we presented a energy aware technique to search on the completely distributed semantic space.
%This search mechanism promotes the end-to-end interaction between the objects.
However, as important as observing what happens in an environment, is to act over it.

In this chapter, we present two techniques to change the environment by writing into the space.
The first one is based on \ac{ts} patterns and uses task and a subscription mechanism.
The second one starts from a goal and tries to fulfill it by calling to \ac{rest} services.
These services are semantically annotated and are read from the space.

Both techniques are explained in further detail and compared in this chapter.
