\section{Background}
\label{background}
% enumerar características de IoT para que se vea el criterio en base al cual evaluamos las soluciones posibles
% Para enfatizar que sí es algo IoT lo que presentamos.
As stated by the \emph{Internet-of-Things Architecture} European project \citep{walewski_project_2011}, the IoT requires the following features:
\emph{interoperability}, to face the heterogeneity of technologies in the IoT;
\emph{scalability}, to cope with a greater amount of devices;
\emph{manageability} of the devices;
ability to face \emph{mobility} situations;
\emph{security} and privacy; and

\emph{reliability}, to handle connectivity losses in various ad-hoc-like ways.
We will use these terms to compare our solution with others
\footnote{Security and privacy are out of the scope of this thesis. They can be considered transversal.}.

\subsection{Sharing Semantic Knowledge in Peer-to-peer}
The problem of sharing semantic knowledge distributedly has gained attention since the first steps of the Semantic Web.
Multiple architectures from the \emph{Peer-to-peer} (P2P) communication model have been used \citep{filali2011survey}.
The P2P architectures are commonly categorized as \emph{unstructured}, \emph{structured}, and \emph{hybrid}.

% Parte del de P-Grid, parte de la survey
% RDFS+ de zhou del 2010 (este es el que clasifica trabajos como de un tipo u otro)
% muhleisen2011survey
% Cuidado: llaman a los protocolos de gossiping epidemic por su forma de propagar consultas
\noindent\textbf{Unstructured.}
In this category, the peers are unaware of the resources stored by other peers.
Therefore, the connections between the peers are based on randomized approaches.
The simplest solution is using flooding \citep{halevy_piazza:_2003,krummenacher_open_2009} which broadcasts every query to all peers to obtain high accuracy.
Other solutions restrict the broadcast by using random routing which leads to less accurate results.
Both cases are inefficient and do not scale well.
To reduce the negative effects of randomness, \citet{zhou_building_2009} uses metadata of neighbor nodes to route the queries and reorganize the topology. % in S-RDF
Interestingly, our solution also uses metadata from other nodes.
However, we do not focus on the network layer and therefore, we do not change the topology.
In contrast, we change the duties of the nodes according to their capabilities.
% edutella al ppio (luego paso a ser super-peers)

% Parte este discurso está sacado de la intro de "P-Grid: A Self-organizing Structured P2P System"
% Otro ejemplo sería swarm-based
\noindent\textbf{Structured.}
In this category, the peers  maintain information about the resource of other peers.
The most common solutions are those based on distributed hash tables (DHT).
DHT solutions calculate the hash functions over the content which needs to be stored or retrieved.
Using this hash, one can know who is the peer in charge of managing this particular content.
% link con lo de arriba
Consequently, the queries can be directed to the appropriate peers generating fewer messages.
Unfortunately, peers joining or leaving these systems result in expensive restructuraction operations.
This maintenance cost makes this solution impractical for networks with high peer mobility (e.g., the IoT).
In addition, the hash function does not consider the different capabilities for the peers.
For example, we have to control the storage and the battery of small devices.
% What if a limited device exhausts its storage or faces much more requests than a powerful server?
% zhou2009 también defiende lo mismo
% "We believe that an unstructured P2P paradigm can better model our collaborative scenario in which peers maintain
% their triples and share them with others."
% "We recognize and respect the rights of individuals to maintain their own data, which precludes highly scalable
%  techniques such as DHTs."
% Otras razones de peso defendidas en la intro: freshness, dependencia de otros
Some examples of DHT-based solutions are
RDFPeers \citep{cai_rdfpeers:_2004},
GridVine \citep{cudre-mauroux_gridvine:_2007},
TripCom\footnote{TripCom (IST-4-027324-STP, www.tripcom.org)}
% ellos lo consideran semi-descentralizado y los kernels funcionan por DHT
or the two architectural solutions proposed by SQPeers \citep{kokkinidis_query_2006}.
% otras aproximaciones como en uso de Semantic Overlay Networks, swarm-based (ignorar para aclarar el hilo)
% AG: estas son las más susceptibles de cambiar!

\noindent\textbf{Hybrid.}
Finally, the \emph{hybrid} architectures differentiate between a set of peers so-called super-peers in charge of complex tasks and the common ones.
The super-peers are usually connected through structured networks while the normal peers rely on any of those super-peers to perform tasks (e.g., query routing).
Edutella \citep{nejdl_super-peer-based_2003} and the second solution proposed by SQPeers \citep{kokkinidis_query_2006} are two examples of hybrid architectures.

\noindent\textbf{Our approach.}
% nos apoyamos en los super-peers sin dejar de tener nodos independientes (una vez tienen las clues)
% porque nosotros nos hemos decantado por esto? comparar con otras categorias y con soluciones de su categoría.
Following this categorization, our solution is a hybrid architecture since some of the nodes in our architecture have special responsibilities.
In particular, we use intermediaries which store what Edutella and SQPeers call indices.
The main difference with these solutions is that the intermediary role is not fix. % as with other super-peers.
Instead, the nodes dynamically decide which one should intermediate according to their energy autonomy and capacities.
Thus, we aim to ease the deployment of our solution and make it flexible and able to adapt to multiple scenarios.
At the same time, the most powerful devices can support those that are resource constrained.


\subsection{Semantics in the Internet of Things}
% intro a que ahora se va a hablar de soluciones IoT que usen semántica
Having analyzed non-specific solutions for distributed semantic architectures, the next step is to evaluate the use of semantics from the IoT perspective.

% Semántica en IoT: SmartM3
Adding semantics works well for devices with high computational capacity but may add too much overhead for most of the devices in the IoT.
To reduce this overhead in such devices, part of this computation is usually delegated to an intermediary.
Some noteworthy examples are Smart-M3 \citep{honkola_smart-m3_2010} and the one proposed by \citet{broring_semantic_2009}.
%In Smart-M3 These intermediaries are called knowledge processors.

These intermediaries or \emph{Semantic Gateways} are in charge of managing the semantic annotation.
The devices send raw data (which can be compressed) to the intermediaries and the gateways annotate the content semantically.
Thus, the devices do not have to care about any semantic aspect and just collect the data as they did before.

These \emph{Semantic Gateways} reduce the load to embedded devices with limited resources by decreasing the number of requests they have to provide.
In addition, a centralized intermediary can gather all the information and thus, reduce the complexity of managing a distributed environment.

However, as previously explained, using intermediaries to store the semantic data of resource constrained devices also has some drawbacks.
On the one hand, centralization does not faithfully represent mobility situations were individuals carry their own semantic information in their personal devices.
In addition, the data obtained from an intermediary will always be less fresh than the one obtained where it is generated (i.e., sensors).
On the other hand, the servers are critical in centralized systems and therefore, their availability determines the operation of these solutions.
They also impose a burden on the maintenance which may be worthless in some simple scenarios.


\subsection{Semantics in the Web of Things}
In the Web of Things, multiple solutions have considered using semantics to enrich the data definition in a machine processable manner.
Generally, these solutions embed the metadata in HTML using microdata, microformats or RDFa \citep{mayer_extensible_2011}.
These contents are returned by the Internet connected objects and are used to enhance the findability of the data by search engines.
% Ontologías no se pueden definir, tiene que haber consenso en su uso por parte de las máquinas de búsqueda.
% en vez de eso, queremos mejorar la busqueda por parte de los cacharros, no de los search engines
This approach does not focus on making the devices able to search and interact with others.
% end-to-end search
Instead, it considers them as mere human-oriented information providers which should be indexed by third party search services.
% aquí se puede enganchar también el discurso de Doulkeridis2007desent: coverage and scalability, freshness y monopoly

A more general way to represent semantic data is using RDF based representations (i.e., full semantics).
SPITFIRE European project\footnote{\url{http://spitfire-project.eu}} represents the most remarkable effort on gathering full semantics and the WoT.
It focuses on fully integrating sensor data with the Linked Open Data (LOD). 
The LOD are datasets which follow a series of principles on how to open and publish data.
The goal of the LOD is to publish linked terms using full semantics.

SPITFIRE shares with our solution the vision of a world populated by devices acting as semantic data providers no matter how small they are \citep{hasemann_rdf_2012}.
Therefore, many of their efforts are complimentary to this work.
%This is done by defining an ontology for mapping other common ontologies and providing semi-automatic generation of semantic annotations from raw data.
%They also propose an abstraction to represent real-world entities (virtual sensors) using data provided by low-level sensors.
%Finally, and more specific to this work, they propose a searching model which predicts the current state of things by computing their periodic patterns in past states.
To search within these providers, \citet{pfisterer_spitfire:_2011} proposes a model which predicts the current state of things by computing their periodic patterns in past states.
Again, the goal of this method is to adapt search engines to the new fashion of data provided on the \emph{Semantic Web of Things}.

Instead, we propose a model to enhance the search capability of web-connected things in a distributed fashion.
We aim to promote the interaction and collaboration between any devices in these environments.
Not only sensors, but also regular computers or mobile devices \citep{balandin_access_2011}.

% ¿Mereceria la pena rescatar el porque DNS no se puede usar sin mas en nuestro caso?
% Yo lo he quitado creyendo que NO por:
%      - Simplificar y no enmarañar mas el discurso.
%      - Es una cosa que me parece basica si se comprende el problema.

% Most WoT solutions, use DNS-based discovery to locate the REST services \emph{Providers} \cite{ishaq_facilitating_2012}.
% In semantic WoT, the use of DNS-based discovery arises as a solution to locate the device holding the response for a specific request.
% Providing that the query already includes the URL of the host that contains the requested information (see Figure \ref{fig:triple}),
% we could easily locate such device using standard network protocols.
% Unfortunately, this does not always apply to Semantic Web for two reasons:
% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%  \item sometimes URIs are not URLs and therefore, they cannot be used as locators but just as identifiers.
%  \item the nature of the semantic web encourages to link concepts, so the same URI may be included in multiple graphs
% stored in different devices.
% \end{enumerate}
% Therefore, any DNS-based resolution strategy should be used only as a complementary mechanism for our clue-based solution.
%

% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{./img/RDFTriple/RDFTriple.pdf}
% \caption{Basic composition of a RDF triple, two examples and a wildcard based template where both examples match.
% \textit{ontprefix} is an alias, known as prefix in most
% Semantic languages, for the beginning of an URI.}
% \label{fig:triple}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Without a DNS-based system, we need to share enough information with the \emph{Consumers} to deduce the relevant \emph{Providers}.
% At the same time, according to the resource constrained devices needs, we want to avoid sharing too much information between the nodes.
% This results in a conflict of interests which should be solved with a trade-off. % IG: esta frase es la descripcion de un trade-off en si
