\section{On the \acs{rest}fulness of \acs{tsc}}
\label{sec:tsc_restfulness}

\subsection{\acl{rest}}
\label{sec:rest}

\acf{rest} is a network-based architectural style proposed by \citet{fielding_architectural_2000}.
% descripción de propiedades de REST: hipermedia distribuído
% que es hipertexto? http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-718
It aims to cover certain properties, explained in Section~\ref{sec:network_properties}.
% Estilos de los que se deriva: ¿?
To achieve these properties, \ac{rest} establishes the following constraints from other network-based architectural styles:
% explicarlo o es demasiado obvio?
\begin{description}
 \item[\acf{rest_cs}.] Providing an \ac{api} to the clients, they are isolated from back-end implementation details.
		       % esto ayuda a: , scalability, evolvability (apps independientes pueden evolucionar mejor)
 \item[\acf{rest_s}.] The state is fully stored in the client and therefore each request has all the information needed to process it.
 \item[\acf{rest_cache}.] When added to the \ac{rest_cs} constraint, this style replicates content obtained from a server in the client.
 \item[\acf{rest_u}.] It is the key constraint which distinguishes \ac{rest} from other architectural styles.
                      This constraint is composed by the following ones:
    \begin{description}
	% explicados en sección 5.2 de Fielding, resumir?
	\item[\acf{rest_id}.] Resources are the conceptual targets of hypertext references.
			      Their identification offers a generic interface to access and change the values of a resource.
	\item[\acf{rest_rep}.] Representations are composed by a sequence of bytes and the metadata to describe those bytes.
	\item[\acf{rest_desc}.] The client and server have to agree on standard methods and media types. % linkar al tipo de la Web esa
				% Explicación Fielding:
				% interaction is stateless between requests
				% standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange information
				% responses explicitly indicate cacheability.
		                %\ac{http}'s content negotiation for instance, allows to reach an agreement on the media types.
	                        Beyond that point, each request or response should contain all the needed data to process it.
	                        Therefore, in \citeauthor{fielding_architectural_2000}'s words,
	                        the type should be registered,
	                        the registry should point to a specification and 
	                        the specification should explain how to process data according to its intent \citep{wahbe_self-descriptive_2010}. % no necesariamente tiene que ser estándar
	\item[\acf{rest_hateoas}.] This is a controversial constraint because most of the self-proclaimed ``\ac{rest}'' \acp{api} fail to follow it \citep{moore_hypermedia_2010,house_how_2012}.
	                           It states that no out-of-the-band information should guide the interaction with an \ac{api}.
	                           Instead, the hypertext should guide it.
	                           In other words, the client must know just an initial URL and the application's media types.
	                           From that point, it should select the alternatives proposed by the server to change to the next application state \citep{fielding_rest_2008}.
	                           % propuestas: respresentaciones (links) y la manipulación implicita de las mismas (CRUD)
    \end{description}
 \item[\acf{rest_l}.] Each layer provides services to the top layer. % e.g. TCP/IP
 \item[\acf{rest_cod}.] The client has a set of resources which does not know how to process.
                        This \emph{know-how} is downloaded from the server.
\end{description}


\subsection{Suitable Protocols for \ac{rest}}
\label{sec:protocols}
% hablar un poco de HTTP y CoAP y decir por qué no hablamos más a menudo de CoAP

% sólo por el correcto uso de ciertos protocolos se puede conseguir todo menos HATEOAS => citar el vídeo aquel
Although an \ac{api} does not adhere to the \ac{rest} style just because it uses certain protocols,
the correct use of some of them can help to achieve most of them \citep{moore_hypermedia_2010}.
Historically, \acf{http} has been considered a suitable protocol in that regard.
\ac{http} is a simple protocol whose adoption by computing platforms is massive.


However, in the last few years \acf{coap} has emerged as a specialized web transfer protocol for resource constrained devices. % has emerged, has arisen?
Some noteworthy features of \ac{coap} are
(1) the reduced message size,
(2) the use of UDP as a transport layer (with the possibility of using \emph{multicast} communication),
(3) similarity with \ac{http} (both to reuse its properties and to ease cross-protocol proxying) and
(4) a resource discovery mechanism. % TODO cita a CORE
% mencionar seguridad?


One could defend that to implement a lightweight \ac{tsc} solution \ac{coap} should be used as a baseline.
However, we have chosen to work with \ac{http} for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Direct interoperation with other web-solutions.
        Most of the Internet-based \ac{api} use \ac{http}.
        Directly using \ac{http} we can avoid proxies.
        Proxies may introduce latency in the response time degrading network performance. % siempre degradará la eficiencia algo, pero habría que verlo y testearlo, la verdad...
        % TODO, será cierto? o tardará menos en conjunto?
  \item \ac{rdf}-based media-formats can be rather verbosed.
	This contrasts with \ac{coap}'s message size limitations.
	Dealing with this limitations was not one main goals of the thesis.
	However, we have considered them at some points of the dissertation to avoid unrealistic assumptions.
  \item \ac{coap} is an ongoing standard.
        Therefore, its definition is currently changing in each draft version.
        A practical limitation of this is that at the moment there are few libraries and tools to work with \ac{coap}.
        This limits the range of platforms which could adopt any proposed solution.
\end{itemize}


Nevertheless, due to \ac{http}'s similarities with \ac{coap}, the future adoption of the latter should be relatively straightforward.

% Ideas no usadas:
% REST no dice nada, pero de facto el protocolo es HTTP
% durante el desarrollo de esta tesis en resource constrained ha surgido CoAP
%   muchas de las cosas aquí comentadas son iguales o mejor sobre CoAP
%   de todas formas, ha habido algo que ha guiado nuestro diseño: librerias existentes => afecta a plataformas
%         si, pero para eso está lo de layered approach! => motivos prácticos



\subsection{\acl{tsc}}
\label{sec:tsc_vs_rest}

\ac{tsc} consist of a shared space which is accessed using some known primitives.
\emph{Per se}, \ac{tsc} does not contradict in any sense the \ac{rest} principles:

\begin{description}
 \item[\ac{rest_cs}.] Accessing to a space through a server in a \ac{rest_cs} fashion is completely feasible.
		      Indeed, this does not prevent to use a distributed solution in the \emph{back end} (e.g. a distributed semantic repository).
 \item[\ac{rest_s}.] The primitives to access the space imply simple read and writes which do not store any state in the server.
 \item[\ac{rest_cache}. ] The semantic content stored in the space can be cached.
                          However, the dynamism of the underlying network can make effective caching challenging to achieve. % quería poner "tune up" pero "configure" me ha sonado más fino
 %\item[\ac{rest_u}:] % lo quito porque si no, este punto sin texto con otros subpuntos queda feo
    %\begin{description}
	\item[\ac{rest_id}.] There are three types of identified resources in \ac{tsc}: spaces, \ac{rdf} Graphs and certain elements of the \ac{rdf} Triples.
	                 All of them are identified by URIs.
	                 The space can be seen as a coarse-grained view of the underlying graphs.
	                 The graphs have sets of triples which are usually related and describe a unit of knowledge. % A RDF triple by itself cannot transmit too much information
	                 Self-identified triple's subjects, predicates or objects are the source of concept linking.
	\item[\ac{rest_rep}.] The \ac{rdf} graphs and triples mentioned above can be represented using different standard serializations.
			      %Nevertheless, 
			      % citar el paper que habla de cómo alinear LOD y REST
	\item[\ac{rest_desc}.] The messages derived from the primitives are self-describing since they are expressed on standard \ac{rdf}-based languages. % including meta-data
				Therefore the server and clients know how to process the content according to its language and certain vocabularies.
				These vocabularies specifications (i.e. ontologies) are referenced in the content.
	\item[\ac{rest_hateoas}.] The lack of native hypermedia support in \ac{rdf}-based representations make this the most challenging property to achieve \citep{page_rest_2011}. % compara LOD y REST
				  However, some recent works propose means to fulfill this property.
				  \citet{kjernsmo_necessity_2012} proposes a vocabulary for hypermedia \ac{rdf}.
				  \citet{steiner_fulfilling_2011} and \citet{verborgh_functional_2012} propose to enrigh the \ac{http} header with hypermedia information.
				  While the first changes representations, the latter is a more general way to provide hypermedia.
    %\end{description}
 \item[\ac{rest_l}.] Encapsulation of functionalities can be achieved through a layered system.
                     For example, to balance the load to a space replicated in two machines.
 % TODO TODO repensar si ontologías, reglas y demás (personalizar behavior) se puede entender cómo COD:
 % In the code-on-demand style [50], a client component has access to a set of resources, but
 %  not the know-how on how to process them. It sends a request to a remote server for the
 %  code representing that know-how, receives that code, and executes it locally.
 \item[\ac{rest_cod}.] Although it may not be as common as scripting in ordinary human-browsing, % TODO reexplicar esto mejor?
            the \emph{know how} can be downloaded from the server in several ways:
            \begin{enumerate}
	      \item Modeling scripts using appropriate ontologies. % TODO cite
	      \item A semantic reasoner can be considered an interpreter for the content downloaded from the server.
	            It is used to extract unstated information from the content received from the server.
	            Therefore, the client downloads know-how to process the resource in the following situations:
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item Through the taxonomies defined in ontology files. % e.g. para hacer un mapeo; en analogía a JS, da igual que tu tengas previamente el script o no
		            This taxonomies are modeled using standard semantic languages. % hablar de distintos niveles de expresividad?
		      \item Through semantically expressed rules \citep{berners-lee_n3logic:_2008}. % (e.g. N3 rules)
		    \end{itemize}
	      % con nuevo TBox que te bajas??
            \end{enumerate}

% TODO citar trabajos de:
%      TSC es como Web para semántica
%      RESTful semántico
%      So far, the compatibility of \ac{tsc} with the \acs{http} RESTful style has been proved from a formal \cite{hernandez_formal_2010} point of view.
%      Papers sobre TSC y su discurso sobre la WWW

In this section, we present a \ac{tsc} \acs{api} over \ac{http} to give a practical overview of \ac{tsc}'s \acs{rest}fulness.

\subsubsection{\acs{tsc} resources}

Three key concepts are important to understand the resources in our proposal: agents share information in a common \textbf{space}.
A space is identified by an \acs{uri}.
Therefore, all the operations in \ac{tsc} are performed against a particular space.
%By default, all applications connect to a common standard space, but they can optionally choose to connect to a particular private space.
Within a space, the information is stored in sets of \textbf{triples} called \textbf{graphs}.
Each graph can also be identified by an \acs{uri}.
The \acs{rdf} \textbf{triples} are the underlying concept of all the \ac{sw} languages.
Each triple is composed by a subject (which is a \acs{uri} or a \emph{blank node}), a predicate (a \acs{uri}) and a value (which can be a \acs{uri}, a \emph{blank node} or a literal), as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:triples_example}.
% TODO cuidado con los blank nodes!!! Los tenemos en cuenta? De ser así, cómo???

As detailed later, \ac{tsc}'s primitives add or remove graphs.
% este es un tema "delicado" desde el punto de vista de TSC, así que mejor si lo tratamos a parte:
% as well as to query for graphs or for sets of triples retrieved from different graphs.
In order to perform these operations, which enable the selection of a subset of the semantic content hold in a given space, a \textbf{template} is required. % these operations: add or remove
The wildcard templates used by default
\footnote{
  % Por qué no SPARQL?
  More sophisticated query languages like SPARQL (\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/}) could be used. % sophisticated o expressive?
  However, not many embedded platforms have parsers for these languages available.
  This could be an obstacle for the adoption of the middleware.
  Therefore, we have opted for using wildcard templates, which are in turn much more simple to process.
  In any case, the nodes able to parse these query languages can easily decompose a query on wildcard templates.
}
are special triples with optional wildcard subject, predicate and/or object.
For example, the template \texttt{?s foaf:knows gomezgoiri:aitor} could be employed to select instances which represent people who know Aitor (see Figure~\ref{fig:tsc_resources}).

\subsubsection{Adopted \acs{tsc} primitives}
\label{sec:primitives}

\acs{tsc} derives some primitives originally defined in the Linda language \citep{gelernter_generative_1985} to access to the semantic information hold in each graph.
In this section, we explain these primitives.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The \textbf{write} primitive allows writing a graph into a given space (identified by its \acs{uri}).
	The set of triples received by this primitive will be stored together in the same graph, returning the \acs{uri} which identifies that graph.
	The graph \acs{uri} can be used to access directly to that graph later on, or to create new triples and relate contents.
       % Esto no encaja necesariamente con el concepto de "Browsable graph": http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData
  \begin{lstlisting}
    write(space_URI, triples): URI              [1]
  \end{lstlisting}


  \item The \textbf{read} returns a graph belonging to a given space which contains at least a triple matching the given template or has the given \acs{uri} as its identifier.
	If more than one graph fulfill one of these conditions, just one of them is returned (nondeterministically).
	It should be remarked that it has been designed as a non blocking operation.
  \begin{lstlisting}
    read(space_URI, graph_URI): triples         [2]
    read(space_URI, template): triples          [3]
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  
% why?
% TODO READ al ser no-deterministica puede afectar a caching???
  \item The \textbf{take} primitive behaves like a destructive \textbf{read}, deleting the graph returned from the space.
  \begin{lstlisting}
    take(space_URI, graph_URI): triples         [4]
    take(space_URI, template): triples          [5]
  \end{lstlisting}

%  \item Space management primitives.
%	A node can join or leave a space using \linebreak \texttt{joinSpace(space\_URI)} or \texttt{leaveSpace(space\_URI)}.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{\acs{http} \acs{api} for \acs{tsc}}
\label{sec:httpapi}

As both \ac{tsc} and \ac{http} are \ac{rest} compliant, their similarities are evident.
In the same way \ac{tsc} has the already explained primitives, \ac{http} has verbs to get, create, update or remove resources (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).
%The main purpose of \acs{tsc} primitives is not to access data but to coordinate the nodes accessing to that data.
Consequently, the translation between these two worlds is straightforward.

\begin{sloppypar}
According to the \ac{rest} principles the interaction with an API must be hypertext-driven \citep{fielding_rest_2008}.
To ease its usage by developers, we provide a human-oriented \acs{html} representation of the \ac{api} which is completely \emph{browseable}.
% un poco repetido de la parte de HATEOAS
Regarding the machine-oriented (i.e. semantic) representation of the \ac{api}, several solutions to enable hypermedia driving have been proposed by \citet{verborgh_functional_2012} and \citet{kjernsmo_necessity_2012}. % mencionar que son experimentales?
Independently of the mechanism adopted, in this section we propose a optional \ac{api} which tries to stress \ac{tsc}'s compliance with \ac{http}.
\end{sloppypar}

The list of spaces a node is joined to are available under \textit{/spaces}.
Each space is identified by an \acs{uri} (e.g. \url{http://space1}).
All the resources of that space, both real (i.e. graphs) or virtual (i.e. query) are listed under $/spaces/\{space\_uri\}$ (summarized by \emph{sp} from now on).
Each graph is available on ${\{sp\}/graph/\{graph\_uri\}}$.
If we make an \acs{http} DELETE to that resource, under \ac{tsc}'s perspective, we take that graph from the space.
The rest of the mappings are shown in the Table~\ref{tab:tscAPI}.

\begin{table} %http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Wide_figures_in_two_column_documents

  \caption {

    \textit{g} is a graph \acs{uri}, \textit{s}, \textit{p} and \textit{o-uri} are subject, predicate and object \acsp{uri} or wildcards (represented with an as \textit{*}).
    When the template's object is a literal, it can be expressed specifying its value (\textit{o-val}) and its type (\textit{o-type}).
    \medskip
  }
  \begin{tabular}{c|l|c}
      \acs{http} request & \acs{url} & Returns \\
      \hline
      POST & \{sp\}/graphs/ & [1] \\
      GET & \{sp\}/graphs/\{g\} & [2] \\
      GET & \{sp\}/graphs/wildcards/\{s\}/\{p\}/\{o-uri\} & [3] \\
      & \{sp\}/graphs/wildcards/\{s\}/\{p\}/\{o-type\}/\{o-val\} & \\
      DELETE & \{sp\}/graphs/\{g\} & [4] \\
      DELETE & \{sp\}/graphs/wildcards/\{s\}/\{p\}/\{o-uri\} & [5] \\
      & \{sp\}/graphs/wildcards/\{s\}/\{p\}/\{o-type\}/\{o-val\} & \\
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:tscAPI}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Status Codes}
\label{sec:status_codes}
The \acs{api} should be compliant with the standardized \acs{http} status codes.
These codes are sent back in the response as part of the header.
For instance, the \ac{tsc} middleware returns the 404 error when no significant result can be found for a primitive.
This adoption, apart from enhancing the compatibility with other web applications, could enable the modular adoption of the API.
For example, if a node does not offer a wildcard based \textit{query}, it will not affect the behavior of the rest of the nodes of an space.
Instead, they will interpret these cases as empty responses.
This modularity becomes crucial to ease the partial adoption on new platforms.

\paragraph{Content Negotiation}
Another key aspect of the \acs{http} protocol the \acs{api} should take advantage of is the \textit{content negotiation}.
This mechanism allows to specify the desired representation for a content on the client side and to express what representation is sent as a response from the data provider side.
For that purpose, the client adds an \textit{Accept} field to the \acs{http} header with a weighted list of media types it understands.
Then, the server will answer with the best possible format it knows about, specifying the \textit{Content-type} in the response.

The benefits of using this mechanism in the \ac{tsc} middleware presented are two-fold.
Firstly, it enhances the browsability of the primitives with human understandable \acs{http} responses. % no sé si esto es de Content Negotiation per se
Secondly, it allows different semantic representations (e.g. RDF/XML\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/}}, N-Triples\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/}} or N3\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/}}).
The latter characteristic becomes crucial since not all the nodes may understand all the formats (e.g. a mobile phone may not have a RDF/XML parser).
%This is true even if all the languages use the same basic concepts (i.e. \acs{rdf} Triples).
In these cases, the compatibility of both sides can be ensured through a conversion carried out in the server side.
Furthermore, expressing the preference for a semantic format can be useful too in other cases.
For example, to obtain the less verbose answer.
