The benefits of the API we propose are: a) the uniformity of the interface eases the learning process of unknown
objects, b) the coordination is decoupled from the communication aspects and the specific implementation for each
platform \cite{gelernter_generative_1985}, c) it does not break any compatibility with other RESTful services as it
can be called by them and d) it facilitates the interoperability of the applications build upon TSC.
