Although in the Chapter~\ref{} and Chapter~\ref{} we refine how they work.
Particularly, 
regarding its network layer.
To make \ac{tsc}'s shared space over the network an underlying network-based architectural style needs to be chosen.


In recent years, the \acf{iot} has became a reality due to the increasing number of everyday objects with computing and networking capabilities.
The use of these everyday objects together with the rising of mobile computing greatly contributes to the \ac{ubicomp} vision.
In the beginning the community put more effort on those devices' connectivity issues, materialized in the spread of technologies such as Zigbee\footnote{http://www.zigbee.org}, 6LoWPAN\footnote{http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/6lowpan/charter/} or Bluetooth\footnote{http://www.bluetooth.com}.
However, nowadays it is focusing on the architectural solutions used by the applications built around these objects.
A model to classify this solutions has been already presented in the previous chapter. % Coulouris et al.


% defendemos usar TSC
In this thesis, we defend that \acf{tsc} provides some valuable properties to \ac{ubicomp} environments. % mencionarlas?
However, some other properties are derived from how \ac{tsc} is implemented.
In this chapter we focus on selecting the underlying network-based architectural style.
% TODO problema: y por qué no otros? Habría que redactarlo de tal forma que no haga que un lector tiquismiquis requiera un puto survey de network-based architectural styles!
%This style guides how \ac{tsc}'s shared space is accessed over the network.
% In the Chapter~\ref{} and Chapter~\ref{} we define...


The REST architectural style, defended by the \acf{wot} initiative, is probably the most prominent architectural solution used for smart-objects. % probably porque no tengo datos que lo defiendan
The benefits that REST brings to resource constrained devices have been deeply described in the previous chapter.
However, in Section~\ref{sec:rest} we analyze the characteristics of the style itself.

In Section~\ref{} we describe the similarities that \ac{tsc} has with the REST style.
Later, in Section~\ref{} we design a \ac{tsc} implementation which respects the REST principles.
The goal pursued is two-fold: (1) inherit most of the properties of REST and (2) maintain a high degree of compatibility with the \ac{wot}.
