\section{Hybrid actuation}
\label{sec:hybrid_actuation}

The actuation technique presented in Section~\ref{sec:actuation_space} is the natural way of acting using a \Space{}.
However, \ac{rest} and \ac{rest}-like services are well-accepted mechanisms to expose limited devices' actuation capabilities \citep{guinard_internet_2011}. %  in the physical environment
Therefore, their seamless integration (i.e., interoperation) opens the door to reuse the capabilities of many existing devices.
This section aims to integrate semantically described \ac{rest} services in our space-based model. % integration, reuse, alignment, close the gap
That is, mix \spaceActuation{} with \restActuation{}.
% we first need to close the gap between both approaches.
%This section aims to experimentally proof the validity of the alignment presented in the previous section.

Section~\ref{sec:actuation_comparison} compares \spaceActuation{} and \restActuation{} and argues the need of this integration.
Then, Section~\ref{sec:actuation_scn3} presents a new implementation of the baseline scenario.
This implementation shows how the \Space{} can transparently invoke \ac{rest} services on behalf of any consumer following the \spaceActuation{}.
To this end, it reuses nodes from the implementations presented in sections \ref{sec:actuation_scn1} and \ref{sec:actuation_scn2}.
%This lead us to analyse the adjustments required to enable their interoperation.


\subsection{Comparison}
\label{sec:actuation_comparison}

The actuation technique explained in Section~\ref{sec:actuation_space} requires a subscription mechanism, but in exchange, it provides space and time decoupling.
Obviously, this decoupling comes at the price of dependency on the \Space{}.
That is, two nodes will not be able to communicate with each other without the \Space{}.


The second approach presented in Section~\ref{sec:direct_actuation} offers independence of the \Space{}: any node can directly invoke a service to act over the environment.
This approach allows reusing \ac{wot} applications' actuation capabilities, providing they are properly described. % apps, APIs o services? % no digo integration/interop porque es sólo one-way
This reuse is enabled by a rule-based reasoning engine. % reasoning engine ya queda bien?
% The unavailability of these engines in many computing platforms may an obstacle for its massive adoption. % como apunte de su practicalidad, pero no sé si venía muy a cuento

The effect of both mechanisms in resource constrained devices is affected by their computing and networking activities.
In order to analyse their impact, we measure two metrics for each implementation: the time and total amount of requests.
In addition, as the number of additional actuators in the physical environment affects these measurements,
we consider four additional variations of the scenarios previously explained. % to capture how they scale to more complex scenarios?
Apart from the scenario with 1 actuator, we contemplate scenarios with 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 actuators.


In order to measure the networking activity, we calculate the total number of requests performed in each scenario.
We assume that each new actuator will behave exactly as each of the actuators described in \implSpace{} and in \implRest{}.
Consequently, in \spaceActuation{} each new actuator writes 2 graphs into the space and in the \restActuation{} each \ac{api} is crawled once.
The crawler checks each of the 5 different calls clients can make to each \ac{api} (1 \acs{http} OPTIONS request and 4 \acs{http} GET requests).
Figure~\ref{fig:requestsTechnique} shows the estimations for these scenarios.


\InsertFig{requests_by_techniques}{fig:requestsTechnique}{Total amount of requests per technique}{}{0.7}{}


% Dado que depende de diseño, lo importante por tanto no es el número ese, sino quienes se ven afectados.
The number of requests which need to be made per new provider depends on the parameters detailed above (i.e. graphs written, times each \ac{api} is crawled and calls needed to discover a whole \ac{api}).
As these parameters are design-dependent, the slopes shown by the Figure~\ref{fig:requestsTechnique} might vary from one implementation to another.
% p.e. podriamos reducir el número de recursos por API o escribir un grafo en vez de dos
In any case, the figure does show that none of the techniques behave in a scalable manner.
However, if we analyse the nature of this network traffic, we can see that
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\bfseries(\arabic*\upshape)]
  \item in the \spaceActuation{} the \Space{} is involved in all the communications, and
  \item in the \restActuation{} \nodeConsRest{} is the source of every request
\end{enumerate*}.


In \spaceActuation{}, all the participants must be aware of what is written into the space to react (i.e., they are proactive).
Both consumers and providers read and write from the space, subscribe to specific changes and receive notifications.
Thanks to this specificity, they are only affected by the contents they are interested in. % reduciendo la actividad
On the contrary, the \Space{} will be involved in any networking activity.
Therefore, although it depends on the number of providers and consumers' interactions, the networking activity will presumably be high for the node hosting the \Space{}.


On the other hand, \restActuation{} requires consumers to have prior knowledge about the environment to reason over it. % frase susceptible de simplificar
Since this knowledge must be acquired from remote nodes before reasoning, this approach demands an extra network usage that the first does not.
Therefore, depending on the network size, this technique might not be appropriate for resource-constrained consumers.


\bigskip


In order to analyse the computation activity in the scenarios' implementations, we measure the time needed to run both implementations of the scenario in a \emph{Raspberry Pi} (Model B\footnote{
RAM Memory: 512MB.

CPU: 700 MHz Low Power ARM1176JZ-F Applications Processor.
}).
In this case, we also contemplate scenarios with 1, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 actuators.
The additional actuators represent smart-heaters and mimic \nodeProvSpace{} and \nodeProvRest{} in each implementation.
That is, in the \spaceActuation{} executions each actuator writes 2 graphs (5 triples in total) and subscribes to temperature preference changes.
In the \restActuation{} executions each actuator has an \ac{api} equivalent to \nodeProvRest{}'s \ac{api} (i.e., 2 rules and 14 triples are exposed).
For example in the \nodeProvRest{} executions with 1000 actuators, the \nodeConsRest{} reasons over 2000 additional rules and 14000 additional triples.
Figure~\ref{fig:timeTechnique} shows the results of these executions (each case is executed N=50 times).
Note that the time measured 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\bfseries(\arabic*\upshape)]
  \item only includes the time \nodeConsSpace{} and \nodeConsRest{} need to make a change in the physical environment (i.e., it excludes actuators' previous writings and subscriptions), and
  \item ignores the delays added by the communication between nodes % networking time?
\end{enumerate*}.


\InsertFig{performance_by_techniques}{fig:timeTechnique}{Time needed to make a change in the environment per technique}{}{0.7}{}


% There is much room for performance improvement in the mechanism
Figure~\ref{fig:timeTechnique} shows that \spaceActuation{} needs much less time than \restActuation{} to make a change.
Furthermore, consumers and providers in \spaceActuation{} only perform trivial computing tasks: interpreting results. % pattern matching sólo en el caso del coordination space!
The space, which corresponds to our solution's \coordspace{}, will be in charge of querying and notification mechanisms.
The computation activity in the space varies depending on the complexity of these mechanisms' implementation, which is beyond the scope of this dissertation.
However, note that due to the prototype nature of the subscription mechanism implemented, for the \spaceActuation{} implementation there is still room for a great performance improvement in this metric. % prototype, prototyping?


Finally, from the time needed to complete the \restActuation{} executions, most of the time is spent reasoning in the consumer.
% Furthermore, this actuation technique also generates additional computation activity on the node responsible for reasoning.
%Both aspects have a negative impact in the energy consumption.
Consequently, from the data consumer perspective, this approach will generally be more energy demanding than the first one. % might porque no está medido, pero es algo intuitivo
In contrast, this mechanism demands few things to the provider: to serve \ac{http} resources and provide their descriptions. % aclarar quien es el provider/actuator?


\bigskip


\input{\pathchapsix/tables/actuation_netcomp}


Table~\ref{tab:actuation_networking_computing} summarizes the previous discussion.
As can be appreciated, the providers in the second actuation mechanism are more lightweight.
They just attend to the request received using HTTP.
As a consequence of these few requirements, exposing the actuation capabilities of the limited devices with HTTP is a consolidated trend.
This tendency is backed by the \ac{wot} initiative.
To make these web-enabled actuators automatically reusable by consumers, the second mechanism only requires them to describe their resources semantically.
This can be done before deploying them and does not affect to their usual operation.


From the perspective of our space-based computing solution, reusing the existing HTTP providers will potentially open a new world of actuation possibilities.
Preferably, we should do it keeping \spaceActuation{} consumers' simplicity. % Simplicidad: networking y computing que aparecen en la tabla.


% ¿Podríamos decir que el proof-based es más genérico?
%  + Space-based es muy dependiente del tipo de datos escritos en el espacio.
%    Proof-based también lo es a decir verdad.
%  + El proveedor del Space-based no tiene forma de saber cómo activar un mecanismo concreto.
%    Salvo que tenga posibilidad de saber a qué se han suscrito otros...
%    No sé como expresar esa diferencia.


\subsection{Baseline scenario: Implementation 3}
\label{sec:actuation_scn3}
\newcommand{\implMix}{\emph{Implementation 3}}

This implementation aims to prove that our space-based middleware can easily reuse third-party applications' providers capabilities. % easily? transparently?
It presents the space and the consumer (i.e., \nodeConsSpace{}) from the \implSpace{}, but it replaces the provider with the one from the \implRest{} (i.e., \nodeProvRest{}).
Both nodes have a good foundation for the interoperation because they use the same vocabularies. % to describe the knowledge they manage.
However, the \nodeProvRest{} and the \nodeConsSpace{} rely on different communication mechanisms: direct communication and indirect communication.


To close the gap between these two worlds, we avoid changing the participant node's implementations.
Instead, we create an agent which acts on the consumers' behalf. % TODO Yo he entendido que se sobreentiende qué es un agente
% WIKIPEDIA: "which derives from the Latin agere (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf"
This agent resides in the same machine as the \Space{}, but its existence must not interfere with the \Space{} one. % dificil explicar en qué terminos: es otro proceso
Therefore, it should run on an independent process.


The agent takes care of the tasks that \nodeConsRest{} does in the \implRest:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape(\arabic*\upshape)]
  \item crawls the discovered \acsp{api}\footnote{The discovery process is out of the scope of this implementation.},
  \item reasons about their data to get a plan, and
  \item follows the resulting plan performing \acs{http} requests.
\end{enumerate*}


To trigger the reasoning, the agent awaits for new tasks written into the space.
Listing~\ref{lst:generic_task_subscription} shows the subscription template used by the agent.
Providing that after reasoning the agent does not find a plan to achieve a task, it will write it into the space again.
This way, another node which may know how to process it may take the task. % TODO discutir porque reasoning va a tener preferencia sobre actuación indirecta!


\begin{listing}
  \input{\pathchapsix/code/scn3/generic_task_subscription.tex}
  \caption{Subscription to any task written into the space.}
  \label{lst:generic_task_subscription}
\end{listing}


Demanding new data from the developer would impede the transparent reuse of the nodes from \implSpace{} and \implRest{}.
Therefore, the agent reuses all the information pieces that it needs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It uses the \nodeConsSpace{}'s subscription to the task result as a goal for the reasoning.
	In our implementation, this correspondence needs a minimal mapping between N3QL \citeweb{n3ql2004} and SPARQL \citeweb{sparql2008}.
	The reason why we use both languages are the underlying frameworks: EYE \citeweb{euler} and RDFLib \citeweb{rdflib}.
	% TODO Justificar?
	
  \item The agent uses all the content written into the space as \emph{additional knowledge} for the reasoning process.
	This is feasible because the agent resides in the same machine as the space. % i.e. it's a local reading, does not demand any network usage
	Otherwise, acquiring this knowledge through the network would be too consuming both in bandwidth and in time.
\end{itemize}


% TODO poner aquí algunos indicadores de la implementación de escenarios?
