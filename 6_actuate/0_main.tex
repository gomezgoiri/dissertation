In the previous chapter, we presented an energy-aware technique to search on the completely distributed semantic space. % technique, mechanism???
%This search mechanism promotes the end-to-end interaction between the objects.
However, acting over an \ac{ubicomp} environment is as important as observing what happens on it.
Although this dissertation describes this problem less thoroughly, we consider interesting to discuss it to provide the complete story. %not leave loose ends. % transmit a broader vision. % the big picture

\bigskip

This chapter presents and compares two techniques to change the physical environment.
The first technique is based on common \ac{ts} usage patterns while the second one relies on semantically described \ac{rest} services to create a plan to fulfil a given goal.
The rest of this chapter refers to them as \spaceActuation{} and \restActuation{} respectively.

Note that the second actuation technique is out the scope of the space-based communication covered in this dissertation.
However, the seamless integration of these \ac{rest} services opens the door to reuse the capabilities of many existing devices.
Therefore, we propose reusing the \acs{http} \acsp{api} of already existing semantically described providers.
% without adapting them to the space-based computation. % a nivel practico hacemos más fácil empezar a usar nuestro middleware

This chapter explores this reuse helped by a simple real-world scenario.
The goal of the scenario is to remotely change the light of a lamp.

\bigskip

This chapter is organized as follows.
Sections \ref{sec:actuation_space} and \ref{sec:direct_actuation} present the two techniques and their corresponding implementations of the baseline scenario\footnote{
The implementations of the baseline scenario have been made public at \url{https://github.com/gomezgoiri/actuation-using-Triple-Spaces}.
\label{fn:impl_available}
}.
Section~\ref{sec:hybrid_actuation} compares these techniques and explores how they can interoperate. % no funciona en ambos sentidos, igual habría que especificarlo!
This exploration is done by means of a new implementation\footref{fn:impl_available} which reuses much of the implementations from sections \ref{sec:actuation_space} and \ref{sec:direct_actuation}.
%Specifically, it presents a consumer willing to indirectly actuate through a space in a semantically described \acs{http} provider. % no sé si queda muy claro
After that, Section~\ref{sec:actuation_discussion} discusses the advantages and limitations of the previous implementation presenting further implementation alternatives.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:actuation_summary} concludes the chapter.
