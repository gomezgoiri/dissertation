In the previous chapter, we presented an energy aware technique to search on the completely distributed semantic space.
%This search mechanism promotes the end-to-end interaction between the objects.
However, as important as observing what happens in an \ac{ubicomp} environment, is to act over it.
Although this dissertation describes less thoroughly this problem, we considered interesting to discuss about it not to leave loose ends. % transmit a broader vision. % the big picture


Therefore, this chapter presents and compares two techniques to change the environment by \emph{writing} into the space. % no se si se entiende que la segunda tambi√©n emula "escribir en el espacio"
The first one is based on \ac{ts} patterns and uses tasks and a subscription mechanism.
The second one starts with a goal and knowledge about the environment.
Then, it reasons to create a plan to fulfill the goal.
This plan comprises calls to \ac{rest} services.
%These services are semantically annotated and are read from the space.
