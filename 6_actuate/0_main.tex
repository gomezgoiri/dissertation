In the previous chapter, we presented an energy-aware technique to search on the completely distributed semantic space.
%This search mechanism promotes the end-to-end interaction between the objects.
However, acting over an \ac{ubicomp} environment is as important as observing what happens on it.
Although this dissertation describes this problem less thoroughly, we consider interesting to discuss it to provide the complete story. %not leave loose ends. % transmit a broader vision. % the big picture


This chapter presents and compares two techniques to change the environment by \emph{writing} into the space. % no se si se entiende que la segunda tambi√©n emula "escribir en el espacio"
The first one is based on \ac{ts} patterns and uses tasks and a subscription mechanism.
The second one relies on semantically described \ac{rest} services to create a plan to fulfil a given goal.
The first approach is described in Section~\ref{sec:actuation_space} and the second in Section~\ref{sec:direct_actuation}.
Section~\ref{sec:actuation_comparison} offers a comparison between them.


Section~\ref{sec:actuation_interoperation} presents a simple scenario implemented using the mentioned techniques.
The second actuation technique is not space-based, but we believe that our space model can be benefited from its adoption.
We pursue the transparent reuse of the capacities of already existing semantically described providers' \acsp{api}.
Therefore, we present a third mixed scenario where we can analyse the requirements for this transparent reuse.


Section~\ref{sec:actuation_discussion} deepens into the implementation alternatives of the mixed scenario
and Section~\ref{sec:actuation_summary} concludes the chapter.
