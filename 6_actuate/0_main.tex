In the previous chapter, we presented an energy-aware technique to search on the completely distributed semantic space.
%This search mechanism promotes the end-to-end interaction between the objects.
However, acting over an \ac{ubicomp} environment is as important as observing what happens on it.
Although this dissertation describes this problem less thoroughly, we consider interesting to discuss it to provide the complete story. %not leave loose ends. % transmit a broader vision. % the big picture


This chapter presents and compares two techniques to change the physical environment.
Section~\ref{sec:actuation_space} describes the first one, which is based on common \ac{ts} usage patterns.
Section~\ref{sec:direct_actuation} presents the second technique, which relies on semantically described \ac{rest} services to create a plan to fulfil a given goal.
Section~\ref{sec:actuation_comparison} offers a comparison between them.


Note that the second actuation technique is out the scope of the space-based communication covered in this dissertation.
However, we propose to enhance the interoperability of our space-based model with existing data providers.
Doing so, our model avoids their adaptation to the space-based computation. % a nivel practico hacemos más fácil empezar a usar nuestro middleware
To sum up, we aim to transparently reuse the capacities of already existing semantically described providers' \acsp{api}.


Section~\ref{sec:actuation_interoperation} explores this reuse through a practical example.
First, it presents simple scenario and explains how to implement it using each of the techniques mentioned earlier.
Then, it shows a third mixed implementation where a consumer indirectly actuates through a space in a semantically described \acs{http} provider. % no sé si queda muy claro
Section~\ref{sec:actuation_discussion} deepens into the implementation alternatives of this mixed scenario
and Section~\ref{sec:actuation_summary} concludes the chapter.
