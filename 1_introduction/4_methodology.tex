\section{Research methodology}

To perform this thesis, the author followed the following phases:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape(\arabic*\upshape)]
  \item awareness of the problem,
  \item solution suggestion,
  \item development and evaluation, and
  \item conclusion.
\end{enumerate*}
Figure~\ref{fig:metodologia_sumidero} represents each of these phases together with their sub-phases. % paso de explicar que las phases son lines y las sub-phases circles


The awareness of the problem phase requires an intensive review of the state of the art in the areas of
space-based computing, \acl{ubicomp} and the \acl{sw}.
As a result, the limitations of the existing works and the areas where it is possible to make a scientific contribution are identified.


The second phase starts with the suggestion of a solution for the problem.
The solution can be refined and adjusted thanks to the feedback given by experts on the field.
These experts are the supervisors, colleagues, partners from research projects where the author has worked or the researchers from external groups where the author has made a research stay. % Lancaster University and the ETH Zurich


The third phase comprises planning, developing, and evaluating the different parts which compose our solution.
The planning involves defining how to develop these parts and how to evaluate that the desired contributions are achieved through them.
Then, the development and evaluation sub-phases are carefully scheduled.
The development sub-phase does not only comprehend the development of the different modules, but also their design.
The evaluation comprehends the preparation of the experimental environment, the development of the experiments, and their execution to precisely measure the indicators previously identified. % input


To conclude the third phase, we contrast the contributions with experts on the field through workshops, conferences and journals.
Note that sometimes a thorough review for a rejected work can be as valuable as the face-to-face feedback obtained at the venue itself. % conference 
As a result of the feedback obtained, the second phase can be iteratively resumed to refine the solution.


When the solution does not require further improvements and it is validated by the research community, it starts the fourth phase.
In this last phase, we analyse the results of our work to obtain conclusions and possible future research lines.
