\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:Hypothesis}

This thesis argues that resource constrained devices can cooperate in a more decoupled manner by sharing semantic knowledge in a shared distributed space.
The distribution should attend the needs of these embedded and mobile devices in terms of computation and energy autonomy.
At the same time, this space should be flexible enough to adapt to different scenarios not breaking compatibility with other upcoming \acl{wot} solutions. % esta ultima no se si me sobra
