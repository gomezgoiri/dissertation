\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:Hypothesis}

This thesis argues that resource constrained devices can cooperate in a more decoupled manner by sharing semantic knowledge in a shared space. % eso de que sea distributed, tiene muchos peros que se comentan despu√©s
Besides, the management of part of this knowledge can be delegated to the limited devices to distribute responsibilities over the participants.
This cooperation should attend the needs of these embedded and mobile devices in terms of computation and energy autonomy.
Finally, the solution should ease the reuse of third applications' semantically annotated data and vice-versa.
