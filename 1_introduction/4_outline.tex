The remainder of this thesis is structured as follow:
Chapter~\ref{cha:stateoftheart} analyses the state of the art in three of areas:
the Internet of Things, the Semantic Web and Triple Space Computing.
It compares the existing solutions and studies their advantages and limitations.

% problema de siempre AmI o IoT?

Chapter~\ref{cha:tsc} discusses the best strategies to adapt TSC to the IoT.
Besides, we explore the compatibility of TSC with the WoT vision.

Chapter~\ref{cha:searching} describes the core of this thesis.
There we present an energy-aware search architecture.
This architecture dynamically adapts to the needs of resource constrained devices.
The goal of this architecture is two-fold:
1) to promote the direct and fully distributed communication between devices,
and at the same time,
2) to reduce the network communications between them, particularly the ones directed to the less powerful ones.

Chapter~\ref{cha:actuate} explores the different manners in which one can use TSC to change the environment.
Ideally, this changes should be done by writing into the space new semantic information.
But due to the information dissemination strategy proposed in Chapter~\ref{cha:searching},
some new communication primitives are needed to inform the appropriate devices.
Particularly, we study two different ways of making these changes:
a service-based approach and a straightforward writing approach. % where the devices express their interest to the rest of participants.

Chapter~\ref{cha:implementation} demonstrates the feasibility of some of the ideas expressed in the previous chapters.
To that end, we have developed a middleware called \emph{Otsopack} which implements the TSC for resource constrained devices.
This middleware is assessed both in a quantitative and in a qualitative way. % measurements and scenarios

Each chapter evaluates our proposals, discusses the related work, and states our intermediate conclusions.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{cha:conclusions} concludes this thesis.
We discuss the achieved goals and remark the advantages and limitations of solution.
Besides, we explain the lessons learn and the future lines of research on this topic.
